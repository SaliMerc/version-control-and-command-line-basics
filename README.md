## Git and Github practice

A project for practicing command line basics and version control using git for version control and vim  for editing the files. 

What was covered:

Creating and switching to a new branch: git checkout -b branchname

After commiting the changes and pushing to the new branch, a merge pull request is created.

Always git pull origin mainbranch before starting working on the new branch.
